#Exploring The BRFSS Data

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all of the states in the United States (US) and participating US territories and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS is an ongoing surveillance system designed to measure behavioral risk factors for the non-institutionalized adult population (18 years of age and older) residing in the US.

The BRFSS objective is to collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population.

**The main goal of this project is to explore the BRFSS data and answer some of the socially relevant questions through the information provided.**

- Research question 1: Is there a correlation between physical activity(pa1vigm_) and general health(genhlth)? If yes, how does it vary with daily vegetable consumption (X_veglt1)?


- Research question 2: Is there any correlation between how much time the person sleeps(sleptim1) and general health(genhlth)? If yes, how does it vary with sex(sex)?


- Research question 3: Is there a correlation between adult smokers(X_rfsmok3) and the number of poor mental health days(menthlth)?
